# Copy/Pipe From Terminal (`cp2code`)

Copy/Pipe data from the integrated terminal to a new editor/tab in VS Code. This is simply done by piping the output of any shell command to the **`cp2code`**, like:

```sh
ls ~ | cp2code
```

## Copy/Pipe data

To copy/pipe data from the integrated terminal into a new editor/tab, follow these steps:

1. Open a new integrated terminal (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd>).

1. Prepare the output stream you'd like to copy into VS Code and pipe into to **`cp2code`**. For example something like this:

   ```sh
   ls -1 / | sort | cp2code
   ```

1. Now you'd see a new editor with the content you just piped.

‚ÑπÔ∏è You may see an unknown command (something like `export COPY_TO_VSCODE_TEMP_DIR=...`) being executed in the newly opened terminal window. That's all OK. It's just the definition of a shell function named `cp2code`, which does the copy/pipe procedure. üçè
